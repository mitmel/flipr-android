Living Postcards
================

Living Postcards are expressive animations that combine time-lapse photography
with geo-location. Each postcard is a collaborative project that many people
can contribute photos to, giving their own perspective on a location in the
city. Use the Living Postcards web and mobile applications to engage with the
urban environment in a meaningful way.
